Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a gaming company that wanted to create a mobile app for their video game. They wanted a mobile app that could be supported across multiple paltforms, so this software had to be cross platform.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation is incredibly comprehensive and thorough, and helps break down the project for the client. This includes pros and cons of different operating environments as well as memory and storage solutions for different scenarios. I also gave them suggestions on how to optimize and manage memory and store it, and the overall costs of the product for different licenses. Finally, I explained how serverless and cloud architecture was the best choice for them due to its ease of use and scalability.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Definitely the UML diagram that was provided. This UML diagram essentially showed me the entire program's design and relationship between components in an easy to read and understand way. It was used as a guidance on how to develop the entire program as well as the classes and variables to use. It was incredibly helpful and I can see why it's important to design code before developing it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would add more information on the advantages and disadvantages of different operating systems. There are countless differences between Linux, Mac, and Windows that you could write entire books about. I just gave a vague overview but there are definitely more nuanced details that weren't excluded as it was meant to be a summary.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We need to make sure that the UI and UX experience is always good. Users should be comfortable with using the product, especially if they paid for it. Otherwise, a company would lose all of its users to competitors. The user experience is very important, so it must be clean, responsive, and functional. There should be no bugs in the software, and if there are bugs, they should be patched quickly. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I started by following the UML diagram with a top-down approach. First, I designed the classes, then the methods, then what was in the methods, and so on. In a way, I coded it "chronologically". I always start with the general class and module design, the instance variables, and the constructor, and then work my way down to individual methods with nuanced functionality. It's important to be able to think about the software in terms of components and the relationships between these components. The more modular the code is, the easier it will be to understand, expand upon, and manage in general.
